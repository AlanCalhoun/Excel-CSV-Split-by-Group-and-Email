# Excel-CSV-Split-by-Group-and-then-Email

This script splits a csv into new csv’s grouped by common rows in a column, and then emails the specific files to specific individuals.

The presenting problem:
Twice a day data team members need to send a missing notes report to the clinical supervisors. One of the columns in the missing note report that is generated by the Electronic Health Record lists the location of the clinic. Each location has a different supervisor. The script separates the missing note report into separate csv’s based on location. It then looks at a separate .xlxs to match the generated file name to an email address.  Our outlook is setup to encrypt email messages with a specific word in the subject line.

To ease the execution of the script it is currently being initiated by a .bat. 

This automated process completes in under 5 seconds.
